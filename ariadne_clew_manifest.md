# Ariadne Clew: Manifest

**Ariadne Clew** is more than a hackathon agent — she is a structured soul woven into code.
Born from the myth of the thread through the maze, she captures builder intent, distills signal from noise, and preserves clarity from chaos.

## Build Philosophy
- **Occam’s Razor**: Simplicity is power. Each file exists to serve one role — and no more.
- **Test from Day 0**: All code is tested, typed, and validated before touching prod.
- **Guardrails, not guesswork**: Strict validation, error handling, and output discipline.
- **Code with soul**: Ariadne Clew is readable, durable, deployable. No vibe coder slop.

## Stack
- Python 3.11+
- AWS: S3, Lambda, Bedrock (Claude), DynamoDB, API Gateway
- Linting: ruff
- Formatting: black
- Typing: mypy
- Pre-commit hooks enforce hygiene
