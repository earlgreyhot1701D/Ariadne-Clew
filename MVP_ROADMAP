# 🧶 Ariadne Clew – MVP Roadmap (Hackathon Lock)

This file hardcodes the MVP scope for the AWS Agent Hackathon.
It exists to prevent scope creep and keep development focused on delivering a working, reproducible, well-architected demo by **October 20, 2025**.

---

## ✅ MVP Definition

**Core Pipeline**
- Input → filters → classifier → code_handler (AST) → diff → recap_formatter → memory
- Output = dual recap (JSON + human-readable)

**Guardrails**
- Replace `exec()` with AST parse
- Input length guard (100,000 chars)
- Deny terms: `password`, `api_key`, `rm -rf /`, `BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY`
- PII scrub (emails + phone numbers)
- Schema enforcement with `extra="forbid"`

**Docs & Logging**
- JSON logging with `request_id` (no raw transcripts)
- Minimal unit tests (smoke coverage only) included in MVP
- Full coverage test suite explicitly post-MVP
- README.md updated to show AWS integration + safety
- PRE_PROD_FIXES.md kept current
- docs/model_eval.md with Claude vs Nova quick table

**AWS Integration**
- Bedrock model (Claude Sonnet or Nova)
- AgentCore Code Interpreter enabled
- Guardrails attached to agent
- S3 → Lambda → API Gateway demo flow
- Frontend: browser upload → recap shown + JSON download

---

## 🚫 Explicitly Out of MVP

These items are deferred until after the hackathon. They should **not** be built before October 20.

- Classifier prompt exemplars (only single baseline prompt used in MVP)
- Side-by-side frontend JSON + human-readable view
- Reasoning trace logs (AC_TRACE)
- AgentCore Memory integration beyond minimal dict fallback
- VS Code extension, GitHub enrichment, semantic search, team collaboration
- Full coverage unit test suite

---

## 🔮 Post-MVP Roadmap Notes

- **Classifier Prompt Exemplars**: Add to improve classification robustness.
- **Frontend Display**: Future versions may show dual output (human + JSON side by side).
- **Trace Logs (AC_TRACE)**: Implemented but off by default; highlight later as a transparency feature.
- **Memory Layer**: Switch from local dict fallback to AgentCore Memory for true cross-session persistence.
- **Expanded Testing**: Move from smoke/unit tests to full coverage suite across all modules.

---

## 🏁 Hackathon Delivery Criteria

- End-to-end pipeline runs from transcript to recap in the browser
- No unsafe code execution
- Inputs >100k chars rejected
- Guardrails scrub PII and deny dangerous terms
- Schema validates every recap
- Judges see dual output: structured JSON + scannable builder recap
